MERN Stack CRUD Operations
This repository demonstrates a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It covers essential CRUD operations for managing data, including:

>> Create: Add new records to the MongoDB database.
>> Read: Fetch and display records from the database.
>> Update: Edit and update existing records.
>> Delete: Remove records from the database.
Features:
--> Frontend built with React for a responsive user interface.
--> Backend powered by Node.js and Express to handle API requests.
--> MongoDB as the NoSQL database for storing and managing data.
--> RESTful API architecture for seamless communication between frontend and backend.
--> Axios for handling HTTP requests from React to the backend API.
--> Mongoose for object data modeling (ODM) to interact with MongoDB.
